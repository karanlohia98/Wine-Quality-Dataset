# Wine-Quality-Dataset
You can easily find this datset at kaggle.
It is a very popular dataset.
I have applied various machine learning algorithms  to it to classify on the basis of wine quality.
It is a very good project for machine learning and data mining.
I have used SVM,Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier.
